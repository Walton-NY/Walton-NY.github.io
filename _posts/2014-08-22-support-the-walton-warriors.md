title: Fall sports added to calendar
---

I've just added the Walton Central School fall sports schedule to the [calendar](/calendar/). I've only included varsity games at home, but you can find modified and away games on the [DigitalSports website](http://walton.digitalsports.com/pages/schedule/schedule.php).

As described on the [Walton Central School website](http://www.waltoncsd.org/protected/ArticleView.aspx?iid=4APA2&dasi=3GPI), all varsity home events will now be played on the middle school/high school fields, in an effort to save costs and increase camaraderie.  Also note that all varsity sports team will have a game on-site during Homecoming, on September 27th. I hope you'll come out and support our local student athletes!
