title: Hello Waltonians!
---

Whenever I read the blog post my sister Beth wrote about Walton ([Thoughts on Home](http://theokeden.com/2013/10/19/thoughts-on-home/)), I am reminded of the hardships we have faced as a community. But, more importantly, I am reminded of the things that make Walton so great. This site is dedicated to celebrating those things that make Walton so special and to making life in this small town all the more worthwhile. I believe that together we can do great things.

My goal with this little site is not to reinvent the wheel, but to:

1. Promote endeavours by others to improve our community,
2. Aggregate information about things to do in our area,
3. Encourage you to get involved and let you know how, and
4. Kickstart brainstorming about how to improve and promote our hometown.

Want to follow along what I have planned? I'm maintaining a living document of [planned posts and site updates](https://hackpad.com/Waltonians.org-Checklist-qT6Q3H280Hi). Feel free to email me at <a href="ogdenchris@gmail.com">ogdenchris@gmail.com</a> with suggestions.
