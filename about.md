Whenever I read the blog post my sister Beth wrote about Walton ([Thoughts on Home](http://theokeden.com/2013/10/19/thoughts-on-home/)), I am reminded of the hardships we have faced as a community. But, more importantly, I am reminded of the things that make Walton so great. This site is dedicated to celebrating those things that make Walton so special and to making life in this small town all the more worthwhile. I believe that together we can do great things.
