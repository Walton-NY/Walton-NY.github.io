The calendar above is compiled from a variety of sites listing local events, as well as the newspaper and word of mouth. Some events are open to all, while others may require tickets or an RSVP. I've mainly listed events right in Walton, but you'll find a few from the surrounding area as well. For more Delaware County events, check out this page at [Kaatskill Life](http://www.kaatslife.com/Delaware%20County%20Events.htm).
