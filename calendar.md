<p class="message">The calendar above is compiled from a variety of sites listing community events (some require tickets or an RSVP). I've limited it to events held within about an hour's drive of Walton, NY, with more consideration given to those within a close proximity. I'll need help keeping it up to date, so please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:ogdenchris@gmail.com">ogdenchris@gmail.com</a> with suggestions and corrections. Please include the event title, date, time, location, and a description if applicable.</p>
